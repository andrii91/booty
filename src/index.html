                <p>Besides looking incredible and attracting more attention, feeling more confident in your jeans <br>or shorts and being bikini-ready all year round there are some more important reasons to have <br>a strong butt!</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h4><span>1.</span> Strong Butt = Better Posture</h4>
                    <p>If you sit at a desk for most of the day and aren’t extremely active on weekends, your glutes will ‘forget’ how to work. Tight <br>or weak muscles can drastically affect your posture and lead <br>to muscular imbalances.</p>
                    <p>You need to specifically train your glutes to strengthen them <br>and wake them up. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4><span>2.</span> Strong Butt = More Fat Burning </h4>
                    <p>Did you know that the “Gluteus” is the biggest muscle group in your body? And having more muscle means you will burn more calories - even when you’re resting. </p>
                    <p>So: if you want to lose some weight, tone up and increase your lean muscle mass, you should be working your glutes. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4><span>3.</span> Strong Butt = Better Injury Prevention</h4>
                    <p>When your glutes aren’t being activated as they should be, <br>your body places a lot of pressure on your knees and ankles <br>to compensate. </p>
                    <p>You can naturally prevent serious injuries to your knees, lower back and hamstrings naturally by giving your booty some extra attention and strength training.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="section_2-quote">In my opinion, these arguments should <br>be enough to convince you to start training your glutes and there’s no better time than now!</div>

              <p> <b>Growing up as a dancer</b>, I kept fit naturally. Staying in shape was never a concern for me. It wasn’t until I had to take a break from training for about two years in High School that I started to gain weight. For the first time in my life, I felt uncomfortable in my own skin. It was awful, and I knew it was time to take action! </p>
              <p>I knew I needed to lose weight, but I knew nothing about nutrition. My “solution” at the time was to eat next to nothing and up my cardio. <b>I quickly went from 66kg to 45kg</b>. While the weight loss was great, it came at a high price: My health. </p>
              <p>I realized I was doing something wrong.<br> So, <b>I started to read all the books </b>I could find on dietetics, nutrition, anatomy, and more. Seeing as my Mother was a doctor, her home library of medical books was of great value! The more I learned, the more I fell in love with health and nutrition. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-6">
            <div class="about-item ml-auto">
              <p>I finally started to understand how I wanted to look: Not only slim and trim, but athletic and healthy. Unfortunately, I lived in a small town with no gyms at all. So,<b> I started training at home</b>. My lifestyle began to change, as did my body.</p>
              <p><b>My hobby became my passion</b>. I studied more, worked out more, and thrived more. I decided it was time to share my calling with the world. So, I gained my fitness and nutrition qualifications and did just that.</p>
              <p>Demand grew, and my purpose in life was clear: <b>To help women worldwide become the best versions of themselves</b>. I learned from every mistake and cherished every victory. I’m blessed to do what I do today, crafting workout programs to help women build their dream bodies and become confident in their own skin. If I could do it, you can too.</p>
